		<h2 title="Band name">Botulinum</h2>
		<p title="Who we are">This is Botulinum Band, from ATX. Formed by Alejandro Suarez, Pool Silva, Chloe Stebbing and Tony Perez. Our music is based on Thrash, hardcore, punk metal influences, and a mix of each member style on the instruments.</p>
		<h2 title="How we started and more">History of the band</h2>
		<p title="The beginnings of the band">Botulinum was form by Alejandro (guitarist) Pool (drummer) and Pedro Perez (Ex bass player) during the month of April in 2017. The band started as a project with 3 first intrumental songs. After a while, the members decided to call the band "Stak" looking for a simple, original and weird name. During almost year and a half, the band struggled looking for a singer and Pedro left the band for personal reasons.<br>The hopes to form a real metal band seemed to fade away every day. One day around December of 2018, Pool decided to invite his friend Chloe to a band practice, after that day Chloe was the spark of hope on this band, which was about to disolve, and in December 18 of the 2018 Chloe become the singer of the band. Months later Chloe introduce Tony to the band. <br>The name Botulinum came as an idea around summer 2019, drinking in bars and thinking crazy stuff after band practices during several weeks. The meaning of Botulinum come from a letal neurotoxic. The reason of this choise, we thought it was stupid and funny how this protein is the most poisonous subtance but at the same time it's used comercially for medical and cosmetic purposes. Then we figure out, there it was our meaning, this society we live on, the civilization capable of putting deathly toxins in their body just for ego, and our band just like Botulinum, toxic music for your body.</p>
